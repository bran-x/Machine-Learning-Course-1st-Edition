# Machine Learning Course 1st Edition

Welcome to the Machine Learning Course 1st Edition repository!

This repository contains the course materials for the Machine Learning Course, 1st Edition. The course covers various topics in machine learning, including regression models, classification models, decision trees, support vector machines, clustering, recommendation systems, and neural networks.

## Course Structure

The course is structured as follows:

- **01-Introduction to Machine Learning:** Introduction to machine learning and linear regression.
- **02-Regression Models:** Linear regression models and project on linear regression.
- **03-Classification Models:** Linear classification models and project on classification.
- **04-Naive Bayes:** Naive Bayes models for classification tasks.
- **05-Decision Trees:** Introduction to decision trees.
- **06-SVM:** Support Vector Machines for classification and regression.
- **07-Boosting:** AdaBoost, gradient tree boosting, XGBoost, and random forest.
- **08-Clustering:** Introduction to clustering, hierarchical clustering, biclustering, advanced clustering techniques, online clustering, and clustering applications.
- **09-Recommendation Systems:** Introduction to recommendation systems.
- **10-Neural Networks:** Introduction to neural networks, functional API, Boston Housing project, Fashion MNIST project, and Tensorboard for visualization.
